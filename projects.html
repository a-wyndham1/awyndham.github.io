				<h3>ANALYSIS OF RACE MISSINGNESS AND MISCLASSIFICATIION IN MEDICARE DATA</h3>
				<p>The research I conducted was based on a paper by Irina B. Grafova and Olga F. Jarrín called “Beyond Black and 
					White: Mapping Misclassification of Medicare Beneficiaries Race and Ethnicity.” I wrote a SAS program that 
					conducted analysis on race data inputted by Medicare beneficiaries. Within this data there were three different 
					measures of race, one self submitted, one based on social security data, and one that was a race-assigning algorithm.
					I first took a look at the levels of missingness in the data across the whole population as well as by state. After that
					I looked at the rates of misclassification by two of the race variables compared to the self-submitted data. The analysis 
					I completed will be released in a paper written by the group I worked with. </p>

				<h3>PHONEMA</h3>
				<p>Alongside two of my peers, I created an android app called Phonema which functioned both as a method for learning 
					phonetics and a way to experiment with language and word creation as a whole. We developed a keyboard that let people 
					hear phonetic sounds as they hit buttons and they could spell out words and sounds as they wished. We presented our app 
					at a school wide meeting as well as a national-level research conference.
