				<h3>FACE BLOCKER</h3>
				<p>
					Face Blocker is a Flask web app that allows a user to generate a version of any photo with the face blocked out. 
					This system integrates a machine learning system that takes the image, detects how many faces are in the image, 
					and produces an output image with all of the faces blocked out. Face Blocker can even use a custom photo the user provides to censor the faces. 
					This system also integrates a MongoDB database using GridFS that facilitates sharing of images between the two other containers. 
					Face Blocker integrates its three systems using docker containers.

					<h3>RATPACK</h3>
					<p> Ratpack is a python package I developed in a group that creates files in any repository mimicking a rat infestation.
						It is a lighthearted package with functions to create the infestation, visualize it, and at the end remove it. I learned a lot from this project about 
						how to write better unit tests and utilized the pytest library. You can visit and use our package <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ratpack/0.1.3/">here.</a>

				<h3>PARK PASSPORT</h3>
				<p>Park Passport is an application that allows users to explore and share their experiences at US National Parks 
					while keeping track of the parks they have visited. I created this app with 3 other peers using flask and pymongo. 
					The MongoDB database stores user information and all our app's data on the National Parks. This project was my first exposure to full-stack web
					development in python.

					<h3>MY PERSONAL LIBRARY</h3>
					<p> My Personal Library is a web app that will allow users to keep track of all the books that they have read and/or want to read. 
						It will enable users to have one big list of all the books they want to store as well as custom bookshelves that they can create. 
						The app will also keep track of all the books entered by all users. <br> <br>

						My Personal Library is a full-stack development project I created using express and Node.js. It integrates a MongoDB Database to store 
						user and book information. You can visit its repository <a href="https://github.com/a-wyndham1/mypersonallibrary">here.</a>

				<h3>ANALYSIS OF RACE MISSINGNESS AND MISCLASSIFICATION IN MEDICARE DATA</h3>
				<p>The research I conducted was based on a paper by Irina B. Grafova and Olga F. Jarrín called “Beyond Black and 
					White: Mapping Misclassification of Medicare Beneficiaries Race and Ethnicity.” I wrote a SAS program that 
					conducted analysis on race data inputted by Medicare beneficiaries. Within this data there were three different 
					measures of race, one self submitted, one based on social security data, and one that was a race-assigning algorithm.
					I first took a look at the levels of missingness in the data across the whole population as well as by state. After that
					I looked at the rates of misclassification by two of the race variables compared to the self-submitted data. The analysis 
					I completed will be released in a paper written by the group I worked with. </p>

					<h3>PHONEMA</h3>
					<p>Alongside two of my peers, I created an android app called Phonema which functioned both as a method for learning 
						phonetics and a way to experiment with language and word creation as a whole. We developed a keyboard that let people 
						hear phonetic sounds as they hit buttons and they could spell out words and sounds as they wished. We presented our app 
						at a school wide meeting as well as a national-level research conference.
