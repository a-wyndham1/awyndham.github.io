					<h3>PAST WORK</h3>
					
					<p> During the summer of 2024 I completed an internship with State Farm as a software engineer. 
						I worked on a project with two other interns and two senior software engineer mentors. Together 
						we explored how Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) could serve the company and implemented a 
						solution using Neo4J and Python, which we then presented to multiple areas of the company. The project was a proof of concept of 
						something that can then be pushed to production. I am looking forward to completing another internship with State Farm 
						this summer after my graduation. </p>
				
					
					<p> During the summer of 2023 I worked at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School on a project called Equity in Caregiving. The project	
						focused on improving the interactions between caregivers and the healthcare system. More information can be found on their <a class = "inTextLink" href = "https://www.equityincaregiving.org"> website</a>.
						I was responsible for updating their website and completing data analysis for a paper that will be published within the next year.
						 I looked at the different ways Medicare beneficiaries' races were stored to see the rates of overall missingness within the race 
						 data as well as how accurate two race classification algorithms worked. To do the second part of the research I compared the a
						ssigned race variables to the self-reported race of beneficiaries. Throughout my time on this team I was also able to interact 
						with members of the community and watch how the team worked together with them to complete their goals. </p>
