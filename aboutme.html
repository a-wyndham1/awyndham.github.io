					<h3>PAST WORK</h3>
					
					<p> During the summer of 2023 I worked at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School on a project called Equity in Caregiving. The project	
						focused on improving the interactions between caregivers and the healthcare system. More information can be found on their <a class = "inTextLink" href = "https://www.equityincaregiving.org"> website</a>.
						I was responsible for updating their website and completing data analysis for a paper that will be published within the next year. 
					    I looked at the different ways Medicare beneficiaries' races were stored to see the rates of overall missingness within the race data 
					    as well as how accurrate two race classification algorithms worked. To do the second part of the research I compared the assigned race variables
						to the self-reported race of beneficiaries. Throughout my time on this team I was also able to interact with members of the community and watch
						how the team worked together to complete their goals.  </p>
